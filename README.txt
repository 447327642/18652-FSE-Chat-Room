This is a simple FSE Chat Room web application. The system allows a user to:

-	Enter the chat room with his/her name
-	See other users' chat messages
-	Post a chat message 
-	Leave the chat room 


The application satisfies the rules:

-	When a user posts a chat message, the text is displayed together with the user¡¯s name and current timestamp. 
-	When there is a new post, the chat room is dynamically updated on all the screens of the users in the chat room (the updates are real time on all client browsers). 
-	All the chat messages are stored on the server in a database and loaded when a user exits and re-enters the chat room.


To run the application, simply run the file "run.bat" (you must have Node.js installed first, and it only works with Node.js version 0.*).
